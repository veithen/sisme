                VC/H (<firstterm>Virtual Circuit over HTTP</firstterm>) is a communication protocol
                that establishes a virtual circuit over HTTP. More precisely it creates a virtual
                two-way stream oriented communication channel similar to a TCP connection. Since
                HTTP itself is based on TCP, the main purpose of VC/H is to tunnel TCP connections
                over HTTP in situations where direct TCP connections between two hosts are prohibited.
            </para>
            <para>
                The protocol is designed to support direct HTTP connections as well as HTTP connections
                that are established through an HTTP proxy. In particular, it is interoperable with
                proxies that buffer requests and/or responses (i.e. that do not forward data immediately
                and only flush the buffered data when the request or response entity is complete) or
                that require the client to transmit the entire request entity before starting to forward
                the response entity.
            </para>
            <para>
                VC/H relies on HTTP 1.1 specific features and doesn't support HTTP 1.0. Since the
                protocol is usually implemented using HTTP clients and servers built specifically for
                that purpose, this is only a restriction in scenarios where the connection has to go
                through an HTTP proxy, because the user of the VC/H implementation in general has no
                control over this proxy.
            </para>
            <para>
                VC/H is specified by a set of request-response exchanges that define the
                HTTP methods, request URIs and headers used by the protocol. Formally, the specification
                closely resembles that of a RESTful service, though the nature of the interaction is
                quite different. Note that VC/H only uses standard HTTP methods as defined by RFC2616
                because some HTTP clients, proxies or servers may not support custom methods.
            </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Client-server architecture</title>
            <para>
                VC/H is a client-server protocol. In particular, connections requests are always
                initiated by the client. Also, in general, a host or process implementing the
                VC/H protocol will either always act as a client or always act as a server.
                Scenarios where a host or process can act both as a client and server will be unusual.
            </para>
            <para>
                A server implementing the VC/H protocol may host different endpoints accepting
                connections from clients. These endpoints are called <firstterm>service
                endpoints</firstterm> or simply <firstterm>services</firstterm>. In general,
                services will differ by the application protocol they implement on top of
                VC/H. Each service is identified by a name that must be unique for the given
                VC/H server instance. In order to be able to connect to a service, a client
                therefore needs to know (1) the host name or IP address of the server, (2) the
                TCP port on which the HTTP server implementation listens and (3) the name of
                the service to connect to.
            </para>
            <para>
                As described above, a VC/H connection establishes a two-way stream oriented communication
                channel between the client and the service endpoint. This connection is full-duplex, i.e.
                data may flow in both directions simultaneously. Once a connection is established, either
                the client or the server may start the conversation, or they may both start sending data.
                Data submitted by the sender application (client or service endpoint) to the VC/H layer
                is not guaranteed to be delivered immediately to the receiving side of the connection, but
                may be buffered by the VC/H implementation or an HTTP proxy through which the connection
                is established. The sender must flush the stream explicitly to push buffered data to the
                receiver. While the flush operation logically divides the stream into individual
                transmission units, VC/H makes no provisions to preserve this structure, i.e. the
                receiver will not be able to detect the corresponding message boundaries.
                Finally, connection shutdown may be initiated either by the client or the service
                endpoint.
            </para>
            <para>
                All these properties make the service provided by the VC/H layer similar to the
                service provided by the TCP protocol. This is of course by design because the primary
                use case of the VC/H protocol is to tunnel TCP connections over HTTP.
